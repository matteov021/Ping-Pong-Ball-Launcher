## Project Description

At the end of this project, a motorized, two-way aiming projectile firing apparatus will be designed and assembled. The goal of the device is to act as a practice tool for users wanting to play ping pong, but may not be able to find another person to practice with.

The project focuses on the use of motors and computer vision to implement functionality of the device. The Raspberry Pi will be used solely for computer vision and implementing stepper motor function. Stepper motors will be used to aid the device's aiming function, which works in tandem with the Raspberry Pi, passing signals and control to the DC motors, which will be doing the main firing of the projectile. 

Connecting everything is a custom PCB which will act as the control systems for the motors, which is electronically connected to the Raspberry Pi. The PCB will only be used as a circuit for the stepper motors and DC motor system. Similarly, the device will only be designed for ping-pong specifically, with no support for other types of sports.

<!-- # Default Github Documentation
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies). -->
